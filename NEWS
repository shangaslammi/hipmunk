Version 5.2.0.6
===============
 - Fixed a memory leak related to collision handlers.

Version 5.2.0.5
===============
 - Always compile @wrapper.c@ and fix Haddock errors
   while handling Unicode.  Thanks, Joachim Breitner.

Version 5.2.0.4
===============
 - New system-chipmunk flag.  When activated, the package will
   use the system-wide installed Chipmunk library.  Thanks,
   Joachim Breitner.

Version 5.2.0.3
===============
 - Update to Chipmunk 5.3.5 and bump dependencies to
   match GHC 7.2.1. (Thanks, Sönke Hahn!)
 - Now Sönke Hahn is also a Hipmunk maintainer.  Awesome!

Version 5.2.0.2
===============
 - Update to Chipmunk 5.3.4.  Note, however, that not all
   functionality available in Chipmunk 5.3.4 is here yet.  But
   the bug fixes and performance improvements are.
 - Fix linking bug present since Hipmunk 5.1.0.  Thanks, Sönke Hahn.
 - Correctly destroy the space in the presence of callbacks.
 - Workaround difficult-to-reproduce bug in Chipmunk where the
   number of contact points in an arbiter would get garbage.
   When that happens (and the garbage does look like garbage) we
   give an empty list of contact points.

Version 5.2.0.1
===============
 - Minor documentation fixes.

Version 5.2.0
=============
 - Use package StateVar for all variables.
 - Do not use Chipmunk's debug mode.

Version 5.1.0
=============
 - Updated to Chipmunk 5.0 revision 402.  'setElasticIterations'
   is now deprecated.
 - New, revamped callback system.  See module
   "Physics.Hipmunk.Callbacks".
 - Support for the new ratchet joint.  Thanks, Owen Anderson.
 - Support for limits on linear and angular velocities.
 - @shapePointQuery@ and @shapeSegmentQuery@ don't filter groups
   and layers anymore.

Version 5.0.1
=============
 - Updated dependencies for GHC 6.12.  Thanks, dons.

Version 5.0.0

   different joint from four to nine.
