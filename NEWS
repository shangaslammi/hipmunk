Version 5.2.0.2
===============
 - Update to Chipmunk 5.3.4.  Note, however, that not all
   functionality available in Chipmunk 5.3.4 is here yet.  But
   the bug fixes and performance improvements are.
 - Fix linking bug present since Hipmunk 5.1.0.  Thanks, SÃ¶nke Hahn.
 - Correctly destroy the space in the presence of callbacks.
 - Workaround difficult-to-reproduce bug in Chipmunk where the
   number of contact points in an arbiter would get garbage.
   When that happens (and the garbage does look like garbage) we
   give an empty list of contact points.

Version 5.2.0.1
===============
 - Minor documentation fixes.

Version 5.2.0
=============
 - Use package StateVar for all variables.
 - Do not use Chipmunk's debug mode.

Version 5.1.0
=============
 - Updated to Chipmunk 5.0 revision 402.  'setElasticIterations'
   is now deprecated.
 - New, revamped callback system.  See module
   "Physics.Hipmunk.Callbacks".
 - Support for the new ratchet joint.  Thanks, Owen Anderson.
 - Support for limits on linear and angular velocities.
 - @shapePointQuery@ and @shapeSegmentQuery@ don't filter groups
   and layers anymore.

Version 5.0.1
=============
 - Updated dependencies for GHC 6.12.  Thanks, dons.

Version 5.0.0
=============

   different joint from four to nine.
